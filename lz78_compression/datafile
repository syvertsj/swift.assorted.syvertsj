This is a test of the simple lossless LZ778 "offset" compression and 
uncompression algorithm.
The implementation uses a hash to store the terms and the index of 
the first occurance. Note, punctuation and case are handled as different 
tokens from lowercase words without punctuation succeeding.
This is not going to work particularly well if there are not many
repeated words. But if there are many repeated words there will
be greater compression. This compression method is very simple
but is used in "lz78" compression algorithm. The implementation is 
simple and intended to be so.
